# SMS-Application https://github.com/its-aritra/SMS-Application/tree/master
It's an android application built to notify an incoming message. When the notification is clicked(tapped) the message content and sender's number is displayed in the application window.
Further an additional feature is added which forwards the message received to a phone number we specify and leaves a toast notification for it.
